# Cornell Rocketry Team Admin Console

This repository holds the source code for the Cornell Rocketry Team's administration console. It is split into two parts, the _client_, which is the part that users see, and the _server_, which handles the back end.

The source code for the client is located in the [`client`](./client) directory, and the source code for the server is located in [this directory](.).


## Server
The server is implemented in the [Go Programming Language](https://go.dev). If you haven't ever written Go before, I'd recommend completing [_A Tour of Go_](https://go.dev/tour). It teaches the fundamentals of Go very well.

The server uses a [MySQL database](https://www.mysql.com/). There are many tutorials online that explain how to configure MySQL online.

The server gets it's configuration information from a `.env` file. It should be in the following format:

```env
DSN=mysqluname:mysqlpw@mysqlserver/mysqldb
CLIENT_ID=something.apps.googleusercontent.com
LOGIN_REDIRECT=serverLocation
SECRET=securelyGeneratedSecret
CORS=clientLocation
```

(Instead of a `.env` file, you can also use environment variables.)

The `DSN` (Data Source Name) explains how the server should connect to the database. It can be in a variety of formats, but the most common is `username:password@server/database`, where `username` and `password` are the MySQL user's username and password, `server` is the location of the server, and `database` is the name of the database.

You also need configure the database. This SQL script will do that for you (I should include this in a better place than the README, but it's here for now). Go to the Cloudflare D1 Console tab for the database and paste this script in:

<details>
<summary>Show SQL script</summary>

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `hour_categories`;
CREATE TABLE hour_categories (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  userId INTEGER,
  name TEXT
);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `hours`;
CREATE TABLE hours (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  userId INTEGER,
  hours REAL,
  date TEXT,
  categoryId INTEGER,
  metGoals INTEGER,
  description TEXT
);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `orders`;
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `subteams`;
CREATE TABLE subteams (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT
);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `users`;
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  netId TEXT,
  fname TEXT,
  lname TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  picture TEXT,
  userLevel INTEGER,
  subteamId INTEGER
);
```

The `CLIENT_ID` is generated by Google and used for Google Sign In functionality. You can generate one by following [Google's Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web).

The `LOGIN_REDIRECT` should just be the base url of your server (for example, `https://localhost:3000`). It is used to tell Google Sign In where to redirect the user after they are signed in.

`SECRET` should be a securely generated secret string for signing cookies.

`CORS` should just be the location of the client (for example, `https://localhost:3001`). It is used for [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

## Client

The client is implemented using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) and [React](https://reactjs.org).  It uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to manage dependencies.

Yarn is super easy to use. To install dependencies, run `yarn`. To start a development server, run `yarn start`. If you want to build a production version of the app, run `yarn build:prod` (or `yarn build:dev` for a development version which should not be used in production).

It also uses its own `.env` file, which uses the following format:

```env
CLIENT_ID=something.apps.googleusercontent.com
BASE_URL=serverLocation
```

(Instead of a `.env` file, you can also use environment variables.)


`CLIENT_ID` should be the same as the server's configuration file, and `BASE_URL` should be the server's address (same as the server's `LOGIN_REDIRECT`).
